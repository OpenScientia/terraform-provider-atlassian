# Resource: atlassian_jira_issue_field_configuration_scheme_mapping

Provides an `atlassian_jira_issue_field_configuration_scheme_mapping` resource.

Learn more about [Jira Issue Field Configuration Scheme Mappings](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-a-field-configuration-scheme/).

See more details about the [Jira Cloud Platform REST API for Issue Field Configuration Scheme Mappings](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-field-configurations/#api-rest-api-3-fieldconfigurationscheme-id-mapping-put).

-> **Note** `atlassian_jira_issue_field_configuration_scheme_mapping` resources can only reference [field configuration schemes](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/what-are-issue-field-configuration-schemes/) used in [company-managed (classic) projects](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-are-team-managed-and-company-managed-projects/).

-> **Note** An [issue type](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/what-are-issue-types/) can only be associated with one [field configuration](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-issue-field-configurations/) within a [field configuration scheme](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/what-are-issue-field-configuration-schemes/).

## Example Usage

### Basic

```terraform
resource "atlassian_jira_issue_field_configuration_scheme_mapping" "example" {
  field_configuration_scheme_id = "10000"
  field_configuration_id        = "10001"
  issue_type_id                 = "10100"
}
```

### Default Mapping

-> **Note** All unmapped issue types are associated to the `default` mapping which is added when an [`atlassian_jira_issue_field_configuration_scheme`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/openscientia/atlassian/latest/docs/resources/jira_issue_field_configuration_scheme) is first created.

-> **Note** You cannot delete the `default` mapping in a field configuration scheme.

```terraform
resource "atlassian_jira_issue_field_configuration_scheme_mapping" "example" {
  field_configuration_scheme_id = "10000"
  field_configuration_id        = "10001"
  issue_type_id                 = "default"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `field_configuration_id` (String) (Forces new resource) The ID of the issue field configuration.
- `field_configuration_scheme_id` (String) (Forces new resource) The ID of the issue field configuration scheme.
- `issue_type_id` (String) (Forces new resource) The ID of the issue type or `default`. When set to `default` this issue field configuration scheme mapping applies to all issue types without an issue field configuration.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the issue field configuration scheme mapping. It is computed using `field_configuration_scheme_id`, `field_configuration_id` and `issue_type_id` separated by a hyphen (`-`).

## Import

`atlassian_jira_issue_field_configuration_scheme_mapping` can be imported using the `field_configuration_scheme_id`, `field_configuration_id` and `issue_type_id` separated by a comma (`,`) e.g.,

```sh
$ terraform import atlassian_jira_issue_field_configuration_scheme_mapping.foo 10000,10001,10100
```
